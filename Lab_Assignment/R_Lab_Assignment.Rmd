## R Assignment 1

* In this assignment, we are going to apply some of the build in data set in R for descriptive statistics analysis.
* To earn full grade in this assignment, students need to complete the coding tasks for each question to get the result.
* After finished all the questions, knit the document into HTML format for submission.

### Question 1

Using the **mtcars** data set in R, please answer the following questions.

```{r}
# Loading the data
data(mtcars)

# Head of the data set
head(mtcars)
```

a. Report the number of variables and observations in the data set.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!
obs_vars <- dim(mtcars)
print(paste("There are total of", obs_vars[2], "variables and", obs_vars[1], "observations in this data set."))

# Answer:
print("There are total of _____ variables and _____ observations in this data set.")
```



b. Print the summary statistics of the data set and report how many discrete and continuous variables are in the data set.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!
summary(mtcars)
print("There are 5 discrete variables and 6 continuous variables in this data set.")

# Answer:
print("There are _____ discrete variables and _____ continuous variables in this data set.")
```



c. Calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation for the variable **mpg** and assign them into variable names m, v, and s. Report the results in the print statement.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!

m <- mean(mtcars$mpg)
v <- var(mtcars$mpg)
s <- sd(mtcars$mpg)

# Print the results
print(paste("The average of Mile Per Gallon from this data set is", round(m, 2), "with variance", round(v, 2), "and standard deviation", round(s, 2), "."))


# print(paste("The average of Mile Per Gallon from this data set is ",  , " with variance ",  , " and standard deviation",  , "."))
```



d. Create two tables to summarize 1) average mpg for each cylinder class and 2) the standard deviation of mpg for each gear class.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!

mpg_by_cyl <- aggregate(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars, FUN = mean)
print("Average mpg by cylinder class:")
print(mpg_by_cyl)

# Standard deviation of mpg by gear class
mpg_sd_by_gear <- aggregate(mpg ~ gear, data = mtcars, FUN = sd)
print("Standard deviation of mpg by gear class:")
print(mpg_sd_by_gear)


```



e. Create a crosstab that shows the number of observations belong to each cylinder and gear class combinations. The table should show how many observations given the car has 4 cylinders with 3 gears, 4 cylinders with 4 gears, etc. Report which combination is recorded in this data set and how many observations for this type of car.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!


print("The most common car type in this data set is car with ____ cylinders and ____ gears. There are total of _____ cars belong to this specification in the data set.")
```

### Question 2

Use different visualization tools to summarize the data sets in this question.

a. Using the **PlantGrowth** data set, visualize and compare the weight of the plant in the three separated group. Give labels to the title, x-axis, and y-axis on the graph. Write a paragraph to summarize your findings.

```{r}
# Load the data set
data("PlantGrowth")

# Head of the data set
head(PlantGrowth)

# Enter your code here!
crosstab <- table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$gear)
print("Crosstab of Cylinders (Rows) vs Gears (Columns):")
print(crosstab)

# Identify most common combination
max_val <- max(crosstab)
most_common <- which(crosstab == max_val, arr.ind = TRUE)

# Extract values
most_cyl <- rownames(crosstab)[most_common[1]]
most_gear <- colnames(crosstab)[most_common[2]]

# Print summary
print(paste("The most common car type in this data set is car with", most_cyl, "cylinders and", most_gear, "gears. There are total of", max_val, "cars belong to this specification in the data set."))

```

Result:

=> Report a paragraph to summarize your findings from the plot!



b. Using the **mtcars** data set, plot the histogram for the column **mpg** with 10 breaks. Give labels to the title, x-axis, and y-axis on the graph. Report the most observed mpg class from the data set.

```{r}

hist(mtcars$mpg,
     breaks = 10,
     main = "Distribution of Miles Per Gallon (mpg)",
     xlab = "Miles Per Gallon (mpg)",
     ylab = "Frequency",
     col = "skyblue",
     border = "black")

# Calculate the most common mpg class
mpg_hist <- hist(mtcars$mpg, breaks = 10, plot = FALSE)
most_common_mpg <- mpg_hist$mids[which.max(mpg_hist$counts)]

print(paste("Most of the cars in this data set are in the class of", round(most_common_mpg, 1), "mile per gallon."))

print("Most of the cars in this data set are in the class of ______ mile per gallon.")
```



c. Using the **USArrests** data set, create a pairs plot to display the correlations between the variables in the data set. Plot the scatter plot with **Murder** and **Assault**. Give labels to the title, x-axis, and y-axis on the graph. Write a paragraph to summarize your results from both plots.

```{r}
# Load the data set
data("USArrests")

# Head of the data set
head(USArrests)

# Enter your code here!


```

Result:

=> Report a paragraph to summarize your findings from the plot!

### Question 3

Download the housing data set from www.jaredlander.com and find out what explains the housing prices in New York City.

Note: Check your working directory to make sure that you can download the data into the data folder. 
if (!dir.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
}

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Load and clean the housing data set 
  dir.create("data")
```

a. Create your own descriptive statistics and aggregation tables to summarize the data set and find any meaningful results between different variables in the data set.

```{r}
# Head of the cleaned data set


# Enter your code here!
if (!dir.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
}
# Download the file into the new data folder
download.file(url = "https://www.jaredlander.com/data/housing.csv",
              destfile = "data/housing.csv", mode = "wb")

# Load and clean the housing data
housingData <- read.csv("data/housing.csv")
housingData <- subset(housingData, 
                      select = c("Neighborhood", "Market.Value.per.SqFt", "Boro", "Year.Built"))
housingData <- na.omit(housingData)

```

b. Create multiple plots to demonstrates the correlations between different variables. Remember to label all axes and give title to each graph.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!
# Boxplot: Market Value per SqFt by Borough
boxplot(Market.Value.per.SqFt ~ Boro,
        data = housingData,
        main = "Market Value per SqFt by Borough",
        xlab = "Borough",
        ylab = "Market Value per SqFt",
        col = "lightblue")

# Scatterplot: Year Built vs Market Value per SqFt
plot(housingData$Year.Built, housingData$Market.Value.per.SqFt,
     main = "Market Value vs Year Built",
     xlab = "Year Built",
     ylab = "Market Value per SqFt",
     pch = 19,
     col = "darkgreen")

```

c. Write a summary about your findings from this exercise.

=> Enter your answer here!
I think the housing prices in New York City really depend on the borough. For example, properties in places like Manhattan have a much higher value per square foot compared to other boroughs.

I also noticed that newer buildings tend to have higher market values, but itâ€™s not always the case. Some older buildings still have high prices, probably because of their location.

Overall, the charts helped me see how both location and the year a building was built can affect housing prices.
